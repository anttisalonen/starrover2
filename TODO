GraphicsTest:
The game's too easy.
 - The AI should be smarter.
  - The AI should predict the position of the player depending on velocity
    and acceleration.
  - There should be different modes for fighting - the easy opponents
    wouldn't predict (like now), some should try to escape at some point.
 - There should be more enemies, and different ships to combat against.
  - Bounty hunter, a pirate or pirate group, a trader, trader convoy.
 - There should be limited time for the player, which is spent whenever 
   losing the ship and flying in the space.
 - The cargo hold should be limited. When capturing cargo, the player
   must be able to choose which cargo to take and which to leave behind.
 - There's a need for some dispensable good, like fuel. (Maybe also
   "hyperspace fuel" for traveling to other star systems.)
 - The cities on planets should have limited cash as well, so that you
   can't jump dump a huge cargo there and get rich.
The game may seem a bit dull to some.
 - Adding some background stars should be easy.
 - Adding planet textures may be doable.
 - There should be a visual effect when accelerating.
 - Sound effects.
 - Music.
The game world needs expanding.
 - We need moons, more planets and more stars.
 - Space stations should be added as well.
 - We need a concept on how to travel between star systems.
 - The market prices should be generated less randomly, depending on the
   characteristics of the planet and nearby planets.
 - There should be more kinds of goods, with different characteristics
   (illegal, demanded or supplied by industrialized planets, etc.).
The player needs more activity.
 - There should be missions, and different countries, fractions and politics
   as a mission generator. We need a concept on how this exactly looks like.
 - Maybe there should be more things for the player to do, like mining on
   planets and on asteroids.
 - One should also be able to fight on planets and attack cities (maybe as a 
   part of a mission).
 - The player should be able to buy a different space ship.
There's a need for some small enhancements.
 - A popup when the player pressed 'q', asking y/n.
 - A 'paused' popup.
 - A main menu with the possibility to view the high score list.
 - An info screen accessible when in space or in cities, showing the cargo
   and cash.
 - Player's name should be entered before the game.
 - The gravity of the astronomical objects should pull the player's ship.
 - Combats should have time limits.
 - The hits on the player should be saved for the following combats and be
   repairable on a shipyard.
 - The used difficulty level should be shown on the high score list.
 - There should be a map for the whole star system available.
 - The player should be able to see current status, e.g. missions, cargo,
   attitudes, score, etc.
 - A 'help' screen, for example in the main menu, would be helpful.
 - There should be some source of information on international relationships,
   like newspapers, etc.
 - The missions should reward the player, by attitude, honors, and money.
 - The "secret message" mission should include returning to the planet which
   issued the mission for reward.
 - The attitudes towards the player should fade with time and due to death.
 - The points calculation should be renewed, so that money, honors and 
   (positive) attitudes are worth more than wins in combat.
 - A mission should consist of commanding a ground attack on an enemy planet.
 - The player should be able to turn displaying of orbits off.
 - Enemy ships should be gradually approached, with more information
   available.
